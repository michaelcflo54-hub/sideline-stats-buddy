## What Happens After Import

1. **Plays are stored locally** in your browser's localStorage
2. **Plays are tied to your team** - only your team members can see them
3. **You can edit any imported play** - click the edit button on any play card
4. **Plays are displayed beautifully** - same format as your PowerPoint with all details

## Troubleshooting

### If import fails:
1. Make sure the file is .pptx or .potx format
2. Check that you're logged in and have coach permissions
3. Look at the browser console (F12) for any error messages

### If plays look incomplete:
- The parser extracts what it finds in the PowerPoint text
- You can always edit any play after importing to add more details
- Position assignments are only included if they're clearly labeled in the slides

## Next Steps

1. **Import your playbook** - Use the Import feature to load all 26 plays
2. **Review the plays** - Check that everything imported correctly
3. **Edit as needed** - Fine-tune any play details
4. **Share with your team** - All coaches on your team can access the playbook
